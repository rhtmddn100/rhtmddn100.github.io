**Research:** My main research interest is in using machine learning and AI to aid synthesis, retrosynthesis, and property prediction of existing and novel molecules. Specifically, I focused on creating powerful molecule representations that can be utilized for the above downstream tasks, using both Transformer and GNN architectures. I am also interested in object segmentation, with focus on camouflaged object detection (COD).
