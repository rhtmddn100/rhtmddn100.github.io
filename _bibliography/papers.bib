  abstract={Estimating the energetic properties of molecular systems is a critical task in material design. Machine learning has shown remarkable promise on this task over classical force fields, but a fully data-driven approach suffers from limited labeled data; not just the amount of available data lacks, but the distribution of labeled examples is highly skewed to stable states. In this work, we propose a molecular representation learning method that extrapolates well beyond the training distribution, powered by physics-driven parameter estimation from classical energy equations and self-supervised learning inspired from masked language modeling. To ensure reliability of the proposed model, we introduce a series of novel evaluation schemes in multifaceted ways, beyond the energy or force accuracy that has been dominantly used. From extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in discovering molecular structures, outperforming other baselines. Furthermore, we extrapolate it to the chemical reaction pathways beyond stable states, taking a step towards physically reliable molecular representation learning.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel approach for the synthesis of ruthenium nanoparticles via the reduction of ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate with sodium borohydride in flow 3D helical reactors in the absence of capping ligands. Manipulating the pH-speciation of the ruthenium precursor and the fluid dynamics of the flow system allows for the synthesis of small nanoparticles and the tuning of average size with narrow size distributions (2–4 ± 0.5 nm). A mechanism is proposed for the NP synthesis involving the formation of a stable ruthenium nitrite complex from the ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate precursor in the presence of sodium hydroxide, which avoids unwanted metal oxide hydrolysis or precipitation. In contrast, more conventional metal precursors such as chlorides or nitrates easily hydrolyse under basic conditions forming metal oxides or precipitates. We also demonstrate the need of achieving fast mixing of reactants (<50 ms) to enable a homogeneous nucleation under such fast reduction kinetics. This work is a demonstration of the need of combining reaction chemistry and engineering approaches on the synthesis of nanomaterials.},
